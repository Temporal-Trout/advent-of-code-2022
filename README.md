# advent-of-code-2022

Simple repo hosting my solution/work on the Advent of Code 2022.
I'm challenging myself to learn rust by completing each challenge only using rust.
I have never programmed with rust before so you really should not use any of these outside of maybe getting ideas for how to solve the puzzles.
